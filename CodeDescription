Description of the code: 
This code creates items in tables and the code that creates the items called the producer. 
Also, the is another code that takes out the items from the table called the consumer. 
Furthermore, there are some rules for this code that the table only can hold two items from the producer code and the producer code must wait if it is full for the consumer to take it out. 
Also from the assignment page (Mutual exclusion should be considered. We use threads in the producer program and consumer program. Shared memory is used for the “table”.)






Note: in the second page is references for all thing I used to solve assignment.
